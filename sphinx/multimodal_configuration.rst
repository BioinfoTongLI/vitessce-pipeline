Configuration for multimodal integration
########################################

The WebAtlas pipeline can process a group of datasets that share common features to be visualised together.
This requires a YAML parameters file similar to :ref:`the one used to run the main pipeline. <parameters_file>`.
The outputs generated by running the main conversion pipeline serve as inputs for this multimodal integration pipeline.

The multimodal integration pipeline performs several tasks:

1. Reindex each dataset by a user-inputed offset so ID's do not clash between them.
2. *Optionally*, concatenate other observation-by-feature matrices or categorical values to the expression matrix to enable their visualisation as continuous values. For example, a celltype prediction matrix and/or celltype categories.
3. Find the intersection of features between all datasets and subset them to visualise only the intersection (as including features not present in all datasets can produce misleading visualisations.)
   **Note** the features are intersected using their index in the AnnData objects (``var`` table). All datasets must use the same type of data as index for the intersection to be correctly computed. For example, all datasets use names as index, or all datasets use IDs as index.

After running the main conversion pipeline you can populate the required YAML parameters file to run the multimodal integration pipeline


.. _multimodal_parameters_file:

***************
Parameters file
***************

The parameters file looks like this:

.. code-block:: yaml

    outdir: "/path/to/output/"

    url: http://localhost:3000/
    project: my_project
    title: "My Project"

    data:
      -
        dataset: scrnaseq
        obs_type: cell
        anndata: /path/to/main/output/scrnaseq-anndata.zarr
        offset: 0
        is_spatial: false
        vitessce_options:
          spatial:
            xy: obsm/spatial
          mappings:
            obsm/X_umap: [0,1]
          matrix: X
      -
        dataset: visium
        obs_type: spot
        anndata: /path/to/main/output/visium-anndata.zarr
        offset: 1000000
        is_spatial: true
        raw_image: /path/to/main/output/visium-raw.zarr
        label_image: /path/to/main/output/visium-label.zarr
        vitessce_options:
          spatial:
            xy: obsm/spatial
          matrix: X

In contrast to the main conversion pipeline's parameters file, this file includes a single `project` to which multiple `datasets` belong to.

Each ``dataset`` block defines the name of the dataset and paths to the converted data and image files (if any).

Each ``dataset`` also requires a set of ``vitessce_options`` that specify the location of certain data (spatial coordinates, embeddings, expression matrix, etc.) within the AnnData object that is processed/generated.
This follows the same structure as in the :ref:`main conversion's vitessce_options <vitessce_options>`.

Additionally, each ``dataset`` requires:

* ``obs_type``, the type of observation of the dataset. For example, "cell" or "spot".
* ``offset``, an integer offset to add to the dataset's ID's so they don't clash with the other datasets.
* ``is_spatial``, whether the dataset contains spatial information and has associated image files (raw and/or label images)

Given that raw images are only read but not modified the pipeline does not generate new output from them.
In order for the output directory (defined by ``outdir``) to contain all necessary files that need to be served for the web application to consume,
by default, the pipeline copies the raw images to the output directory.
This process can take a long time depending on the size of the image.
You may want to manually copy or move the image or serve it from its own directory separate from the rest of the output.
The default copying can be disabled by setting ``copy_raw: false`` as a project-wide parameter (at the same level as ``outdir``, ``project``, etc).
For example,

.. code-block:: yaml

    outdir: "/path/to/output/"
    url: http://localhost:3000/
    project: my_project
    title: "My Project"
    copy_raw: false


With additional features
========================

Using the above example parameters file to run the multimodal integration pipeline will run the reindexing and intersection steps.
To perform the concatenation of additional features (like celltypes) to visualise them as continuous values, some extra parameters need to be added.

As a project-wide parameter (at the same level as ``outdir``, ``project``, etc.):

* ``extend_feature_name``, the name of the additional feature. For example, "celltype"

And at a ``dataset`` level:

* ``extend_feature``, the location of the additional feature information.
  This can be either the path to a *cell2location* output file, or the location within the AnnData object where the feature is stored as a categorical within ``obs``.
  For example, ``/path/to/c2l.h5ad`` containing predicted continuous values, or ``obs/celltype`` containing categoricals.

The full parameters file will then look like this

.. code-block:: yaml

    outdir: "/path/to/output/"

    url: http://localhost:3000/
    project: my_project
    title: "My Project"

    extend_feature_name: celltype

    data:
      -
        dataset: scrnaseq
        obs_type: cell
        anndata: /path/to/main/output/scrnaseq-anndata.zarr
        extend_feature: obs/celltype
        offset: 0
        is_spatial: false
        vitessce_options:
          spatial:
            xy: obsm/spatial
          mappings:
            obsm/X_umap: [0,1]
          matrix: X
      -
        dataset: visium
        obs_type: spot
        anndata: /path/to/main/output/visium-anndata.zarr
        extend_feature: /path/to/c2l.h5ad
        offset: 1000000
        is_spatial: true
        raw_image: /path/to/main/output/visium-raw.zarr
        label_image: /path/to/main/output/visium-label.zarr
        vitessce_options:
          spatial:
            xy: obsm/spatial
          matrix: X

With this parameters the multimodal integration pipeline will concatenate the expression matrix with the additional feature values so both can be queried and visualised across datasets within the same portal.
